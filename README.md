# Exchange-The-Game
Note:
This online game is based on a real board game called Exchange which was designed by Eric Sillies and published by Bicycle. However there are some minor changes to the game mechanics although I tried to make the visuals similar to the original.

Introduction:
Exchange is a game about stock market with the basic concepts of economics such as supply and demand as well as exchange rates. Players must carefully predict the market changes and buy/sell their owned properties accordingly to make the best profit possible. To win this game, you will have to lie, manipulate, deceive, and scam the other players for your own interests. So, the morality and ethical concerns take a back seat to cutthroat tactics to make piles of cash. Basically, just like real life stockbrokers. This game is really fun to play since it involves both thinking a few steps ahead of your opponents and trying to predict their own economic behavior.  

How to play:
The game lasts 5 rounds. In each round the players have to choose their 3 phases.
Phase 1: 
-Choose the type of property that you want to buy or sell.
There are 3 types of properties in this game. Red, green, and blue (very original I know). Each property is represented as a circle with its corresponding color. 
Phase 2:
-Choose if you want to buy or sell the property and specify amount.
In this phase, you'll decide whether to buy or sell the chosen property and specify the amount. Watch out for those market changes and think carefully. If you sniff an opportunity for red to get cheaper, it's your chance to stock up and make a killing. But remember, this action won't take effect until all players have made their choices, so stay sharp!
Phase 3:
-Choose the influence on the market.
Probably the most important phase of the game. In Phase 3, you get to choose how you want to influence the rate of your selected property. If you choose the influence rate of +1 then the property rate will increase by 10$ and -1 will decrease by 10$. However, if the rate hits rock bottom at 10$ and you chose the influence of -1, it'll skyrocket to 90$. If it's 90$ and you chose the influence of +1, then it will crash down to 10$. This is simply the best mechanic of this game since you can abuse it to bankrupt other players and make massive profits. Just remember, the order of player turns determines when each Phase 3 action takes effect, so plan your moves wisely!
With Exchange, you'll experience the thrill of outsmarting your opponents, predicting their economic behavior, and executing diabolical plans to secure your financial supremacy. It's a game that combines strategic thinking, cunning calculations, and dominating victory whileâ€™s laughing hilariously at your opponents. So wake your inner broker and have fun !
